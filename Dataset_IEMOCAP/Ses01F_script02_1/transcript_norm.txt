Ses01F_script02_1_M025	163.1900	176.2823	yeah but this this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever
Ses01F_script02_1_M026	176.3975	181.5500	this is a big night for these little guys it s like life s last orgy
Ses01F_script02_1_F018	180.6769	189.4500	i don t see why you re so excited this isn t a freaking moon landing we are talking about it s fish it s a fish nobody even eats

Ses01F_script02_1_M028	191.1300	201.9700	okay well whatever but it s a fish who do something no other fish do it s like those swallows returning to capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs
Ses01F_script02_1_M029	202.0250	209.4025	there s like mystery here there s magic it s like a little bit of the unexplainable i just can t see how you re not interested

Ses01F_script02_1_M032	218.6125	225.2700	and last year i remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you don t remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car
Ses01F_script02_1_F022	224.5800	237.0050	last time you ll also remember we got our shoes wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions
Ses01F_script02_1_M033	236.5000	238.7700	ahh we weren t in a good spot
Ses01F_script02_1_F023	238.1400	240.7300	hmm we didn t see them the year before either

Ses01F_script02_1_M037	261.5675	276.6283	right now out there there is this mass of silver fish and it s heading this way no one sent them an invitation no one told them no one even gave them a map
Ses01F_script02_1_M038	276.7775	291.4000	just all at once they turned and they formed this line as long as the california coast and some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming
Ses01F_script02_1_M039	291.4700	298.1386	they are swimming right now they are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them
Ses01F_script02_1_M040	298.2452	305.6600	it s single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is just pure urge
Ses01F_script02_1_M041	305.9850	316.0900	and they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death
Ses01F_script02_1_M042	316.1527	321.7375	oh look i m giving myself goose bumps my hairs are standing up on my arm
Ses01F_script02_1_F024	321.2100	323.8200	that s the wind
