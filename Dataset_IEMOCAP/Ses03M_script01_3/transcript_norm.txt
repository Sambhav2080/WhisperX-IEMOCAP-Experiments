Ses03M_script01_3_F026	233.2111	235.9371	you got to tell me
Ses03M_script01_3_M026	235.7844	238.9684	i don t know where to start
Ses03M_script01_3_F027	238.3796	241.9124	okay it wouldn t work like this
Ses03M_script01_3_M027	243.9405	249.4578	you remember overseas i was in command of a company
Ses03M_script01_3_F028	248.1930	250.3738	yeah sure
Ses03M_script01_3_M028	250.1557	252.8162	well i lost them
Ses03M_script01_3_F029	252.7072	254.9098	how many
Ses03M_script01_3_M029	254.1683	256.6762	just about all
Ses03M_script01_3_F030	256.2836	258.5953	geez
Ses03M_script01_3_M030	258.2862	263.8721	takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren t just men
Ses03M_script01_3_M031	264.0975	276.0196	for instance one time this it had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket
Ses03M_script01_3_M032	276.0850	286.1925	that s just a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had they didn t just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly
Ses03M_script01_3_M033	286.2625	297.9175	a little more selfish and they d still be here today and i got this idea watching them go down see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created
Ses03M_script01_3_M034	297.9900	305.7700	it was a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me
Ses03M_script01_3_M035	305.8650	316.6907	and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him
Ses03M_script01_3_M036	316.8217	329.4952	and then i came here and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident
Ses03M_script01_3_M037	329.6400	341.5275	and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all
Ses03M_script01_3_M038	341.6350	351.2996	it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive i felt wrong to have that new checkbook
Ses03M_script01_3_M039	351.3650	357.7111	open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
Ses03M_script01_3_M040	357.8637	370.2505	cause you can take those things out of the war but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that
Ses03M_script01_3_M041	370.3325	375.1136	otherwise what you have is loot and there s blood on it
Ses03M_script01_3_M042	375.2492	382.1793	and i didn t want to take any of it and i guess that included you
Ses03M_script01_3_F031	382.4192	385.8212	and you still feel that way
Ses03M_script01_3_M043	385.2760	388.0673	i want you now annie
Ses03M_script01_3_F032	387.7184	394.5100	cause you must not feel that way again you hear me you can t you deserve everything you have chris
Ses03M_script01_3_F033	394.6050	407.4260	that includes me too i mean and the money you have right to that money your father put planes up in the air good planes and he deserves it you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that
Ses03M_script01_3_M044	404.0087	405.4917	annie
Ses03M_script01_3_M045	407.0182	410.6601	annie i m going to make a fortune for you
Ses03M_script01_3_F034	411.0308	414.9780	what am i going to do with a fortune
Ses03M_script01_3_M046	415.3051	417.3100	buy some hats
