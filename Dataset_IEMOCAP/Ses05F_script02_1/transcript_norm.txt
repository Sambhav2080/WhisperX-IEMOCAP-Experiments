Ses05F_script02_1_M018	140.3700	147.6153	honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean it happens like once a year it s a great opportunity
Ses05F_script02_1_M019	147.6392	157.1300	think about people in kansas they have to get a a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh but we are just forty minutes away too good to pass up
Ses05F_script02_1_F013	156.7200	163.8899	pass up what its little fish one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die
Ses05F_script02_1_M020	163.5600	175.9470	yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you mating or spawning or something like that
Ses05F_script02_1_M021	175.9708	180.8800	this is a big night for these guys life s last orgy yeah
Ses05F_script02_1_F014	179.7833	186.4000	what are you so excited about i mean it s not it s not rocket science we are talking about its fish its fish nobody even eats
Ses05F_script02_1_M022	186.0900	187.7600	yeah they do
Ses05F_script02_1_FXX0	187.6931	188.3720	augie
Ses05F_script02_1_M023	188.2700	197.4900	okay but they are fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that
Ses05F_script02_1_M024	197.5100	205.6607	there s there s mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable i can t understand how you could not be interested
Ses05F_script02_1_F015	205.7400	207.6622	i am just not
Ses05F_script02_1_M025	207.2700	208.6900	for real
Ses05F_script02_1_F016	208.1300	209.5400	yes
Ses05F_script02_1_M026	209.9800	221.0800	i don t get it the first time we came out here you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn t notice it until you got into the car
Ses05F_script02_1_F017	220.4000	231.3700	last year you also remember our shoes got wet and i got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight you had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions
Ses05F_script02_1_M027	230.4400	232.3720	we weren t in a good spot
Ses05F_script02_1_F018	232.1337	234.4600	we didn t see them the first time either
Ses05F_script02_1_M028	234.1200	239.5800	we just weren t in a good spot this is a much better spot i got a great instinct for these things
Ses05F_script02_1_M029	239.6000	246.7166	look there what s that is it is that a ah it s a seaweed isn t it
Ses05F_script02_1_M030	246.7880	254.7300	oh this is great i wouldn t miss this for the world i mean think about this i know you are not interested but think about this for a second
Ses05F_script02_1_M031	254.7600	270.4256	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction they don t know why and we don t know why they didn t get an invitation and it wasn t a vote it wasn t a decision and nobody sent them a map or anything like that
Ses05F_script02_1_M032	270.4494	281.1720	it s just some little instinctual time release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the california coast and just started swimming
Ses05F_script02_1_M033	281.2197	310.2662	they are swimming right now as if it s the only thing that matters it s it s single mindedness with no mind urgency that s pure urge it s they don t know what drives them they they don t give any name or ask any question they just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death god it s giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm popping up
Ses05F_script02_1_F019	308.6100	310.7189	that s the wind
Ses05F_script02_1_M034	310.9000	315.2200	well so what do you think
