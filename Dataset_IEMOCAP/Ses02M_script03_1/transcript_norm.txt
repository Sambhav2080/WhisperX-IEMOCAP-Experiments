Ses02M_script03_1_M028	179.9197	185.0409	the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown
Ses02M_script03_1_F025	183.4941	188.0446	it burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom
Ses02M_script03_1_M029	186.7230	189.3062	that was a rouser wasn t it
Ses02M_script03_1_F026	188.6003	191.8743	that was the first time you ever hit me

Ses02M_script03_1_F027	192.7754	200.6450	the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers
Ses02M_script03_1_M031	199.3084	201.8314	i ll never forget his face
