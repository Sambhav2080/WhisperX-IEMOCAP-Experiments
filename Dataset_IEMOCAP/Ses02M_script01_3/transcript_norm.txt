Ses02M_script01_3_F019	182.4666	192.0214	well what s wrong i mean even in your letters there was some something ashamed
Ses02M_script01_3_M022	190.9891	196.8120	yeah i suppose i have been but it s going from me
Ses02M_script01_3_F020	196.0709	199.7234	you ve gotta tell me
Ses02M_script01_3_M023	199.9881	203.1642	i don t know how to start
Ses02M_script01_3_F021	202.2113	206.0226	it wouldn t work this way
Ses02M_script01_3_M024	206.0226	214.3334	it s all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in charge of a company
Ses02M_script01_3_F022	213.7247	216.0803	yeah sure
Ses02M_script01_3_M025	216.3450	220.2621	well i lost them
Ses02M_script01_3_F023	220.0504	223.1206	how many
Ses02M_script01_3_M026	222.9618	226.0585	just about all
Ses02M_script01_3_F024	225.3174	228.1494	gee
Ses02M_script01_3_M027	227.3025	234.5281	it takes some time for a guy to toss that off cause they weren t just men
Ses02M_script01_3_M028	234.6340	249.8263	for instance this one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks i put them in pocket it s only a little thing but those are the kind of guys i had
Ses02M_script01_3_M029	249.9322	260.0957	they didn t die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly i mean a little more selfish and they d have been here today
Ses02M_script01_3_M030	260.1751	276.8495	i got this idea watching em go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that one new thing was made a sort of responsibility man for man you know what i mean
Ses02M_script01_3_M031	276.9290	289.3951	to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him
Ses02M_script01_3_M032	289.5539	310.0662	then i came back and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here i mean the whole thing to them seemed like it s sort of a bus accident i went to work with dad and that rat race again
Ses02M_script01_3_M033	310.1721	332.6959	and i felt what you said ashamed somehow cause nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator
Ses02M_script01_3_M034	332.7753	346.0090	i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you ve gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man you ve gotta be a little better because of it
Ses02M_script01_3_M035	346.0355	360.1426	otherwise all you have is really loot and there s blood on it and i didn t want to take any of that and i guess that included you
Ses02M_script01_3_F025	359.3486	362.8688	do you still feel that way
Ses02M_script01_3_M036	363.0540	366.5213	i want you now annie
Ses02M_script01_3_F026	365.3567	374.8585	cause you mustn t feel that way because you have a right to everything you have chris everything you understand that me too
Ses02M_script01_3_F027	374.9644	383.4604	i mean and your money there s there s nothing wrong with your money i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air a man should be paid for that
Ses02M_script01_3_M037	382.9311	388.3834	i know annie i m gonna make a fortune for you
Ses02M_script01_3_F028	387.7482	391.1095	what ll i do with a fortune
