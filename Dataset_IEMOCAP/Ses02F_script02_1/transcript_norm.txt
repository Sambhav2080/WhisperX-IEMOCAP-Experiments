Ses02F_script02_1_M024	136.8900	143.8500	think about the people in kansas they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this we live forty minutes away it s too good to pass up
Ses02F_script02_1_F013	143.1900	150.1900	pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach they flop around and swim away and then they die
Ses02F_script02_1_M025	149.6700	159.0000	yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating i mean
Ses02F_script02_1_M026	159.0500	162.0100	this is a big night for these guys life s last orgy
Ses02F_script02_1_F014	161.3900	168.6000	what are you so excited about i mean it s not a moon landing we re talking about here it s fish it s a fish nobody even eats

Ses02F_script02_1_F015	169.8600	171.2700	ah augie
Ses02F_script02_1_M028	171.2300	179.6300	alright but it s fish that do something that none of the other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
Ses02F_script02_1_M029	179.6700	186.6100	there s there s a bit of the magic some unexplainable here i don t see how you can not be interested
Ses02F_script02_1_F016	185.8000	187.5400	i m just not
Ses02F_script02_1_M030	187.5800	188.7000	for real

Ses02F_script02_1_M032	194.8400	202.5300	and last year i remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn t even notice until we got in the car
Ses02F_script02_1_F018	201.7700	211.4700	last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got in a big fight over nothing and we didn t see the grunions
Ses02F_script02_1_M033	211.4300	213.0800	we weren t in a good spot
Ses02F_script02_1_F019	212.7100	214.9300	we didn t see them the first time either
Ses02F_script02_1_M034	214.5300	220.1000	we just weren t in a good spot this is a much better spot believe me i ve got good instincts for these things
Ses02F_script02_1_M035	220.6300	225.0800	there is that no that s just seaweed isn t it
Ses02F_script02_1_M036	225.1400	233.2600	oh man this is great isn t it i wouldn t miss this for anything here think about this all right i know you re not interested but think about this
Ses02F_script02_1_M037	233.3800	239.7300	somewhere out there this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way
Ses02F_script02_1_M038	240.0400	247.1500	they don t know why we don t know why nobody sent them an invitation or a map it wasn t a decision just
Ses02F_script02_1_M039	247.1700	261.5400	all as one this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming and they re swimming right now as if that s all that matters
Ses02F_script02_1_M040	261.7400	271.7000	it s like single mindedness with no mind it s urgency that s pure urge they don t know what drives them they don t ask it a question or give it a name
Ses02F_script02_1_M041	271.7100	280.1800	they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death
Ses02F_script02_1_M042	280.2100	284.6400	ah god i m giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are popped up
Ses02F_script02_1_F020	284.0400	285.6000	that s the wind
