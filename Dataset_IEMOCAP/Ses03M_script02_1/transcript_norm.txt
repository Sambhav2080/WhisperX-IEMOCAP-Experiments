Ses03M_script02_1_F013	180.1315	188.0500	pass up what these fish swim up to shore on the beach and then they flop around a little they swim away and then they die
Ses03M_script02_1_M024	187.1896	199.3435	well this is like the highlight the one night of their lives and that flopping around that s laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it
Ses03M_script02_1_M025	199.3930	205.6761	but this is the big night for these guys their last life s last orgy
Ses03M_script02_1_F014	205.0824	213.5093	what are you getting so excited about i mean it s not like it s like the landing on the moon or something i mean it s just fish fish that nobody eats

Ses03M_script02_1_M028	231.0887	234.2715	i mean i can t see how you can not be interested
Ses03M_script02_1_F016	233.7108	235.9866	i m just not

Ses03M_script02_1_M031	243.3125	250.1194	and last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn t even notice it until we got in the car
Ses03M_script02_1_F018	250.1029	259.7750	you also could remember that i got sand in my panties we got in an argument over nothing you got a sore throat and we didn t even get to see the grunions
Ses03M_script02_1_M032	259.1400	262.2050	okay we re in a good spot
Ses03M_script02_1_F019	261.6796	264.4501	you didn t see them the first time either

Ses03M_script02_1_M036	280.6575	286.5775	i mean think about this i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute
Ses03M_script02_1_M037	286.6150	299.1050	somewhere out there there s this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they don t why we don t know why they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies
Ses03M_script02_1_M038	299.1650	317.5925	like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming this way they didn t you know they didn t make a decision they didn t you know have boats or anything no one sent them an invitation or a map they just started swimming as if that s the only thing that matters
Ses03M_script02_1_M039	317.6500	328.8550	it s single mindedness with no mind it s urgency that s pure urge and they don t they don t ask it a question they don t give it a name they just swim
Ses03M_script02_1_M040	328.9100	335.6750	they just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death
Ses03M_script02_1_M041	335.7475	341.1200	oh i m giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are standing up
Ses03M_script02_1_F020	340.6551	342.8649	that s the wind
