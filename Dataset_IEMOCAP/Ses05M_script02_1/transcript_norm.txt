Ses05M_script02_1_M018	164.0779	173.3600	i mean think about people in kansas they ve got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this we re just forty minutes away it s just too good of an opportunity to pass up
Ses05M_script02_1_F013	172.8200	179.4200	pass what up it s it s just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die
Ses05M_script02_1_M019	179.1600	185.5500	yeah but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives you know
Ses05M_script02_1_M020	185.5600	194.6549	and all that about flopping around it s like laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating or something like that
Ses05M_script02_1_M021	194.6649	201.6300	i mean this is a big night for these guys you know life s last orgy
Ses05M_script02_1_F014	200.8700	207.0300	what are you so excited about this isn t rocket science this is just fish fish nobody even eats
Ses05M_script02_1_M022	206.5600	208.2700	yeah they do
Ses05M_script02_1_F015	207.6300	209.3300	augie
Ses05M_script02_1_M023	208.8900	227.0400	all right but they are fish that do something no other fish do like the swallows were turning into capistrano or lemmings jumping off the cliffs you know like that there s there s magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable you know i can t see how you could not be interested
Ses05M_script02_1_F016	227.0200	228.7500	i m just not
Ses05M_script02_1_M024	228.5500	230.1800	for real

Ses05M_script02_1_M025	230.6100	245.0700	i don t get it i mean the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn t even notice until you got in the car
Ses05M_script02_1_F018	243.5000	253.4100	well if you also remember last year we our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we had a big argument you had a sore throat and we didn t see the grunion
Ses05M_script02_1_M026	252.9300	254.8500	we weren t in a good spot
Ses05M_script02_1_F019	254.6000	257.1800	we didn t see them the first time either
Ses05M_script02_1_M027	256.6800	263.5500	we just weren t in a good spot this is a much better spot i ve got a great sense for these things
Ses05M_script02_1_M028	270.5500	276.6800	look there what is that is that oh no that s seaweed
Ses05M_script02_1_M029	276.8500	285.1000	oh this is great i wouldn t miss this for the world i mean think about this i know you re not interested but just think about this for a second
Ses05M_script02_1_M030	285.1312	319.2700	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction they don t know why they re doing it we don t know why they re doing it they didn t it wasn t a decision no one took a vote nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that it was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off and all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the california coastline and they just started swimming they are swimming right now at this very moment and and
Ses05M_script02_1_M031	321.5400	333.1800	and it s single mindedness with no mind it it s urgency it s pure urge i mean they didn t make any decisions they don t ask any questions they don t give it a name
Ses05M_script02_1_M032	333.1900	348.2400	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death god it s giving me goosebumps look at all the hairs that are standing up
Ses05M_script02_1_F020	347.3700	348.7200	that s the wind
Ses05M_script02_1_M033	348.4000	353.2800	well so what do you think
