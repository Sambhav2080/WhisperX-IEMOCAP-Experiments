Ses03F_script01_3_M027	233.9814	242.6817	yeah i guess there is i guess i was but uh it s going from me now
Ses03F_script01_3_F027	242.9345	246.3472	you should tell me
Ses03F_script01_3_M028	245.2517	248.2431	i don t know where to start
Ses03F_script01_3_F028	247.6743	251.8454	but chris it wouldn t work like this
Ses03F_script01_3_M029	253.2779	259.2186	you know when i went overseas i said i was in command of a company
Ses03F_script01_3_F029	258.1442	260.0823	yeah sure
Ses03F_script01_3_M030	259.6820	262.0525	well i lost them
Ses03F_script01_3_F030	261.9782	264.5272	how many
Ses03F_script01_3_M031	263.5792	266.6760	just about all
Ses03F_script01_3_F031	266.0440	269.3724	geez
Ses03F_script01_3_M032	268.1600	274.7232	it takes a little while to toss that off because they weren t just men
Ses03F_script01_3_M033	274.7654	285.4669	for instance one time it had to have been raining several days there was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket
Ses03F_script01_3_M034	285.5301	300.3818	i mean that s that s only a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had they didn t just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they d still be here today
Ses03F_script01_3_M035	300.6556	306.7648	and i and i thought something watching them go down
Ses03F_script01_3_M036	306.8325	320.1207	everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me
Ses03F_script01_3_M037	320.2050	331.3279	and to show that to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him
Ses03F_script01_3_M038	331.3911	342.5350	and i came back here and it was incredible there was no meaning in that here the whole thing to them was a bus accident
Ses03F_script01_3_M039	342.5982	356.8225	and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys
Ses03F_script01_3_M040	356.8600	376.6975	and i felt wrong to be alive to drive the car to see the new checkbook to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man and you got to be a little bit better because of that
Ses03F_script01_3_M041	376.7750	381.1071	otherwise what you have here is loot and there s blood on it
Ses03F_script01_3_M042	381.1703	384.0985	and i didn t want to take any of it
Ses03F_script01_3_M043	384.1825	387.8904	and i guess that included you
Ses03F_script01_3_F032	388.0379	391.4295	and you still feel that way
Ses03F_script01_3_M044	390.9661	393.9364	i want you now annie
Ses03F_script01_3_F033	393.3676	401.9525	because you can t feel that way never again chris you hear me never i mean the money and me too
Ses03F_script01_3_F034	402.0150	410.2837	i mean there s nothing wrong in that money and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that
Ses03F_script01_3_M045	409.7570	412.3271	annie
Ses03F_script01_3_M046	412.4925	415.8030	annie i m going to make a fortune for you
Ses03F_script01_3_F035	414.7775	419.3842	what am i going to do with a fortune
