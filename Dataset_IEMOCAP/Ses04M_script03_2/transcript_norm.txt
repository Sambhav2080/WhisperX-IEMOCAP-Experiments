Ses04M_script03_2_F001	15.7500	22.0670	the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers oh dear
Ses04M_script03_2_M002	21.6000	24.4400	i shall never forget his face

Ses04M_script03_2_M005	33.8200	36.9700	i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him
Ses04M_script03_2_F005	36.4700	39.2000	presents a trivial little brooch
Ses04M_script03_2_M006	38.7000	42.9000	i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste
Ses04M_script03_2_F006	42.2600	46.6700	not at all it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often
Ses04M_script03_2_M007	46.0700	49.2300	you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden
Ses04M_script03_2_F007	48.4700	52.4000	i did not you made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination
Ses04M_script03_2_M008	51.9000	55.1700	you must admit that he was in love with you wasn t he
Ses04M_script03_2_F008	54.7400	58.5600	just a little perhaps nothing serious

Ses04M_script03_2_F033	206.7100	212.1477	on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
Ses04M_script03_2_M038	211.5664	217.0300	very interesting and how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine
