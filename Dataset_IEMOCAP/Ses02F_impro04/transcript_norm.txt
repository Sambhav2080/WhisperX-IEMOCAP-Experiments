Ses02F_impro04_M004	52.9062	65.8663	i know i know it s hard but you just you gotta keep going i mean you ve been going at it for so long you know something is definitely going to come up i i know it will because you re a good worker
Ses02F_impro04_F005	63.8300	74.6400	i just keep getting rejected i just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can t get a job
Ses02F_impro04_M005	74.5400	82.1500	no it s i mean it s competitive you know that s that s what it is that s what you gotta be is competitive
Ses02F_impro04_F006	80.3700	91.5702	yeah but maybe if just because it s competitive like maybe i m just not good enough maybe the level is here and i m here and there s just no way i m ever gonna do that
Ses02F_impro04_M006	89.4093	97.0700	there there are plenty of people out there with with like good jobs you know that are a lot
Ses02F_impro04_M007	97.1700	104.0000	dumber than you i mean they re a lot worse off than you you are much better off than like a lot of those people in there i know
Ses02F_impro04_F007	102.4700	111.8000	i didn t have like one of those starts you know like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand
Ses02F_impro04_M008	111.5500	116.4043	i know it makes it harder i mean it s definitely who you know in a lot of cases but
Ses02F_impro04_F008	117.2799	129.1165	it s just so frustrating like i just i just don t wanna do it anymore you know i just don t wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time you know it s just like
Ses02F_impro04_M009	129.3592	135.0900	but you gotta otherwise what is what s your other option
Ses02F_impro04_F009	132.9672	135.2700	i feel so worthless
Ses02F_impro04_M010	135.8500	145.0570	it s not worthless cause it s definitely gonna it s definitely gonna pay off i know it i mean i can i ve just i ve seen your work etiquette you know you re a good worker and
Ses02F_impro04_M011	145.0670	151.0500	and there s no reason that that something won t come up like really soon all right so you just gotta
Ses02F_impro04_F010	150.3800	156.5983	and what would make you say that there doesn t seem to be any indicators that anything s going to get better
Ses02F_impro04_M012	156.7354	174.3532	because i know you you know and maybe once you get to know some more people like talking to them and everything they ll get to know you too and they ll realize they should ve hired you three years ago you know but and and they ll finally come around and believe me it ll you gotta
Ses02F_impro04_F011	173.3600	192.9300	it s just really hard i feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me you know what i mean like it s like suddenly it starts to feel like it s just you that they say no to and it s not that they re not taking applications and it s not that they re not hiring people it s just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you you know
Ses02F_impro04_M013	192.8400	205.9900	well maybe yeah but maybe you get to that point where it s like you bug em and then they just don t wanna hear from you anymore but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it s gonna annoy them so much that they re gonna be like all right fine you know
Ses02F_impro04_F012	204.9700	207.2100	or they ll never talk to me again
Ses02F_impro04_M014	207.1941	212.1841	or well no okay you
Ses02F_impro04_F013	212.2790	229.8000	i i just i think maybe i should try something else i mean i i don t know all growing up this is the only thing that i ever wanted to do and yet i can t i m not physically able apparently i mean
Ses02F_impro04_M015	229.5000	242.2700	that obviously that s not true though i mean you ve done this before you ve done all the work like this before you know and and you ve gotten people saying oh you re so good and like you know
Ses02F_impro04_F014	242.0100	248.8300	i guess the money shouldn t matter to me but somehow it does you know it s not like i do it for the money but
Ses02F_impro04_M016	244.7900	245.9000	right
Ses02F_impro04_M017	245.9700	248.0000	well you ve gotta live
Ses02F_impro04_F015	248.8600	256.9182	you have to i mean if you re hired by somebody then you re not a professional you re an amateur and that means that you re not good enough
Ses02F_impro04_M018	257.1676	266.4900	i mean it s just it s really i don t know yeah it s about their opinions and it s about i don t know just getting yourself out there and

Ses02F_impro04_M019	271.6900	277.0401	well come on come on thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though
Ses02F_impro04_F017	276.0900	286.5100	i don t know how to get out of it i don t know how to dig myself out of it it s the same hole that i ve been digging and digging and digging i can t
