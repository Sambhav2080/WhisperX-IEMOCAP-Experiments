Ses05F_script01_3_M022	225.4415	227.7550	i don t know how to start
Ses05F_script01_3_F020	228.5963	231.1802	it wouldn t work like this
Ses05F_script01_3_M023	232.5647	236.2579	it s it s mixed up with so many other things i
Ses05F_script01_3_M024	238.1007	242.0467	remember when i was overseas i was in command of the company
Ses05F_script01_3_F021	241.5760	243.2685	yeah sure
Ses05F_script01_3_M025	244.7207	247.1344	yeah i lost them
Ses05F_script01_3_F022	247.4448	249.2376	how many
Ses05F_script01_3_M026	249.9286	252.0118	just about all
Ses05F_script01_3_F023	251.9617	253.9647	oh gee
Ses05F_script01_3_M027	255.6227	262.7380	takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren t just men
Ses05F_script01_3_M028	264.1301	276.4087	for instance there s this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks you know he just put them in my pocket
Ses05F_script01_3_M029	276.8093	291.7100	i know that that s not a big thing but it s just the kind of guys i had they didn t die they they killed themselves for each other
Ses05F_script01_3_M030	291.7219	296.8998	i mean that exactly that a little more selfish and they would have still been here today
Ses05F_script01_3_M031	298.4020	308.0466	and i got an ideal watching them all go down everything was being destroyed see and
Ses05F_script01_3_M032	308.2770	319.1635	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man do you understand me
Ses05F_script01_3_M033	319.6242	333.7856	and to show that to to bring that back onto the earth again like a like a monument and everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would make a difference for them
Ses05F_script01_3_M034	337.0306	347.2400	and then i went home and it was incredible it had no meaning here
Ses05F_script01_3_M035	349.3378	361.0570	it was all like some kind of bus accident to them i went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again
Ses05F_script01_3_M036	363.4706	376.4700	and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys and
Ses05F_script01_3_M037	377.3900	393.2457	it felt wrong to be alive to open that bank book to buy that new car to look at that new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but if you drive that car you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man and you ve got to be a little bit better than that
Ses05F_script01_3_M038	393.2758	402.6099	and if you re not then it s all just loot and it s got blood on it and i don t want any of it and i guess that included you
Ses05F_script01_3_F024	404.1923	406.6600	do you still feel like that
Ses05F_script01_3_M039	407.9600	410.7823	i i want you now annie
Ses05F_script01_3_F025	410.4317	427.7079	because you can t feel like that anymore chris you hear me i mean everything that you have you deserve and that includes me and your father your father put hundreds of planes in the air you should be proud a man should be paid for that
Ses05F_script01_3_M040	426.7965	431.8242	oh annie annie i am going to make you a fortune
Ses05F_script01_3_F026	431.1832	434.1377	what would i do with a fortune
