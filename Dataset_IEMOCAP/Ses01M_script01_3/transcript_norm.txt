Ses01M_script01_3_M023	256.1412	259.1271	i don t know
F	0.0000	0.0000	but what if
Ses01M_script01_3_M024	259.3510	263.9700	it s kind of all mixed up with all these other things
Ses01M_script01_3_F022	265.5717	269.0800	wouldn t work like this
Ses01M_script01_3_M025	272.3400	277.8637	you know over seas i was in command of the company
Ses01M_script01_3_F023	277.2300	279.3900	yeah sure
Ses01M_script01_3_M026	281.1400	283.9100	well i lost them
Ses01M_script01_3_F024	285.5100	288.3400	how many
Ses01M_script01_3_M027	288.1800	291.0300	pretty much all
Ses01M_script01_3_F025	290.5787	293.7900	geez
Ses01M_script01_3_M028	293.6392	307.4900	takes awhile to toss something like that off i mean they weren t just men you know
Ses01M_script01_3_M029	307.7375	320.0300	for instance there was this one time when this kid it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks
Ses01M_script01_3_M030	320.1175	326.5000	he just put it in my pocket that s the kind of guys i had
Ses01M_script01_3_M031	327.3700	337.8600	they didn t die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly you know a little more selfish and they ll all be here today
Ses01M_script01_3_M032	339.8710	363.7300	and i had this idea as i was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed you know but i felt like this one new thing was being made you know it s kind of like this this monument
Ses01M_script01_3_M033	363.8650	373.3200	you know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know
Ses01M_script01_3_M034	374.5675	388.8175	i thought i would change everything you know and i got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all
Ses01M_script01_3_M035	389.0888	397.0950	you know i went to work with dad and i started that whole rat race again
Ses01M_script01_3_M036	397.3498	405.6900	and no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them
Ses01M_script01_3_M037	406.2000	414.2600	driving my new car and i felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator
Ses01M_script01_3_M038	417.2900	430.7600	cause you can take those things out of a war but you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man
Ses01M_script01_3_M039	431.0408	439.0700	and if you can t see that then it s just loot and there s blood all over it
Ses01M_script01_3_M040	439.4800	449.9100	i felt ashamed and i didn t want any part of it i guess i included you too
Ses01M_script01_3_F026	455.2600	458.7400	do you still feel that way
Ses01M_script01_3_M041	460.4000	463.8500	i want you to know annie
Ses01M_script01_3_F027	464.0599	472.8700	cause you mustn t feel that way everything you have you have a right to
Ses01M_script01_3_F028	473.5225	480.1500	everything chris do you understand that to me too
Ses01M_script01_3_F029	481.6500	495.6700	and your money there s nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes into the air you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that
Ses01M_script01_3_M042	499.4600	502.2700	annie
Ses01M_script01_3_M043	507.7700	511.4612	i m going to make a fortune for you
