Ses02F_script01_3_F020	176.8257	185.9200	then what s wrong i mean even in your letters there was some something ashamed
Ses02F_script01_3_M021	186.5800	191.1500	yeah i suppose i have been but it s going from me
Ses02F_script01_3_F021	191.1300	193.3241	you ve gotta tell me
Ses02F_script01_3_M022	193.8700	196.2000	i don t know how to start
Ses02F_script01_3_F022	196.6900	198.6400	it wouldn t work this way
Ses02F_script01_3_M023	200.0900	207.2400	it s all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in command of a company
Ses02F_script01_3_F023	206.9900	208.4100	yeah sure
Ses02F_script01_3_M024	209.2300	211.3800	well i lost them
Ses02F_script01_3_F024	211.6000	213.3000	how many
Ses02F_script01_3_M025	214.0700	215.6400	just about all
Ses02F_script01_3_F025	215.8937	217.6679	oh gee
Ses02F_script01_3_M026	218.0900	223.2800	it takes some time for a guy to toss that off cause they weren t just men
Ses02F_script01_3_M027	224.1600	238.3000	for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks i put them in pocket it s only a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had
Ses02F_script01_3_M028	238.3700	247.3600	they didn t die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they d have been here today
Ses02F_script01_3_M029	247.9400	261.6500	i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that there was one new thing being made a sort of responsibility man for man
Ses02F_script01_3_M030	261.6900	273.3400	you know what i mean to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him
Ses02F_script01_3_M031	274.7500	290.0600	then i came back and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident i went to work with dad and that rat race again
Ses02F_script01_3_M032	290.3500	307.6700	and i felt what you said ashamed somehow cause nobody was changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator
Ses02F_script01_3_M033	308.7100	320.4500	i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you ve gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man you ve gotta be a little better because of it
Ses02F_script01_3_M034	320.8300	330.7300	because otherwise all you have is really loot and there s blood on it and i didn t want to take any of it and i guess that included you
Ses02F_script01_3_F026	331.4300	333.6900	you still feel that way
Ses02F_script01_3_M035	334.6100	336.6000	i want you now annie
Ses02F_script01_3_F027	336.9100	344.5400	cause you mustn t feel that way because you have a right to everything that you have do you understand that everything chris and me too
Ses02F_script01_3_F028	344.6000	353.2200	i mean and your money there s nothing wrong with your money i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air a man should be paid for that
Ses02F_script01_3_M036	353.6400	357.8700	i know annie annie i m gonna make a fortune for you
Ses02F_script01_3_F029	357.6900	360.0600	what ll i do with a fortune
