Ses01M_script03_2_F000	9.1274	12.4425	utterly utterly ridiculous
Ses01M_script03_2_M001	11.9100	13.7800	we were very much younger then
Ses01M_script03_2_F001	13.1400	15.7700	very much sillier
Ses01M_script03_2_M002	14.5300	16.6600	mmhmm
Ses01M_script03_2_M003	17.1948	22.5087	however i do believe the real cause of that row was peter burden
Ses01M_script03_2_F002	22.0335	26.6200	oh you knew there was nothing in that
Ses01M_script03_2_M004	25.5100	30.3200	i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him
Ses01M_script03_2_F003	29.6100	34.1900	presents it was a trivial little broach
Ses01M_script03_2_M005	33.4300	37.3100	it was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste
Ses01M_script03_2_F004	36.6200	41.2588	not at all it was very pretty i still wear it often
Ses01M_script03_2_M006	40.6323	46.4500	you sent out of your way to torture me over peter burden
Ses01M_script03_2_F005	45.4500	49.7800	i did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination
Ses01M_script03_2_M007	48.8400	54.1300	well you let him kiss you you said you did
Ses01M_script03_2_F006	53.5900	55.8830	well what of it
Ses01M_script03_2_M008	55.5157	57.7839	what of it
Ses01M_script03_2_F007	57.3735	63.4867	it gave him a lot a great deal of pleasure and it didn t hurt me
Ses01M_script03_2_M009	62.8602	65.9708	and what about me
Ses01M_script03_2_F008	65.6468	70.4725	if you hadn t been so suspicious and nosey you d never known a thing about it
Ses01M_script03_2_M010	70.2675	73.5745	that s a nice point of view i must say
Ses01M_script03_2_F009	73.7041	77.9800	i m bored with this conversation

Ses01M_script03_2_M014	103.3845	111.6100	you can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on
Ses01M_script03_2_F013	111.9700	118.0700	i just i just think it s becoming a habit with you

Ses01M_script03_2_F028	230.5800	236.6800	on the contrary a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
