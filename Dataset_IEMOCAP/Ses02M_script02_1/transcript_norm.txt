Ses02M_script02_1_M037	250.6700	255.4100	out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way
Ses02M_script02_1_M038	255.4800	264.0400	they don t why we don t know why they didn t take a vote or anything they didn t get a map or an invitation
Ses02M_script02_1_M039	264.1100	282.9385	just all as one this little time sensitive firecracker instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the california coast and started swimming they re swimming right now as if that s the only thing that matters
Ses02M_script02_1_M040	282.9700	294.5000	it s single mindedness with no mind it s urgency that s pure urge they don t know what drives them they don t ask it a name or ask it a question
Ses02M_script02_1_M041	294.9900	304.3800	they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death
Ses02M_script02_1_M042	304.4400	307.9100	look at me i m giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up
Ses02M_script02_1_F020	307.2600	308.7900	that s the wind
