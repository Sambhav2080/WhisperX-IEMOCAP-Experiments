Ses01M_script02_1_M027	200.4000	205.8000	it s not stupid it s a natural phenomenon
Ses01M_script02_1_M028	205.8575	215.6599	people in kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this it s only forty minutes away it s just too good to pass up
Ses01M_script02_1_F017	215.1712	224.1800	pass what up these little fish swim out of the ocean they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die
Ses01M_script02_1_M029	223.5940	238.3125	yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it s like spawning or mating or something this is like the highlight of their little fish lives it s like life s last orgy
Ses01M_script02_1_F018	237.7400	248.4000	i don t know what you re so excited about this isn t a moon landing we re talking about it s fish it s a fish nobody even eats
Ses01M_script02_1_M030	247.9200	249.5200	yeah they do
Ses01M_script02_1_F019	248.9900	251.1912	oh augie
Ses01M_script02_1_M031	250.5900	266.3200	well okay whatever okay but it s a fish who do something that like no other fish do you know it s like those swallows that return to capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs you know
Ses01M_script02_1_M032	266.4000	274.4825	it s like a little bit of the unexplainable a little magic a little mystery i just don t see how you can not be interested in this
Ses01M_script02_1_F020	273.9800	276.1435	i m not
Ses01M_script02_1_M033	275.5000	277.3075	for real
Ses01M_script02_1_F021	276.9400	278.4400	yes
Ses01M_script02_1_M034	279.6900	282.8100	all right
Ses01M_script02_1_M035	289.5300	296.9725	i don t get it though i mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life
Ses01M_script02_1_M036	297.0800	305.0900	and last year i remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn t realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car
Ses01M_script02_1_F022	304.4200	318.4303	last year you ll also remember we got our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions
Ses01M_script02_1_M037	317.7800	320.0133	we just weren t in a good spot though
Ses01M_script02_1_F023	319.6100	321.8200	we didn t see them the year before either
Ses01M_script02_1_M038	321.2400	325.9100	we just weren t in a good spot i m telling you this is a much better spot
Ses01M_script02_1_M039	326.8820	338.7500	come on trust me i got instincts for these things okay so just just think about it all right okay i know you re not interested think about it
Ses01M_script02_1_M040	338.9269	347.0862	out there there s like this big mass of silver fish they re heading this way
Ses01M_script02_1_M041	347.1150	355.9600	they don t know why we don t know why no one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction
Ses01M_script02_1_M042	356.0100	367.2140	they just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the california coast and they just started swimming
Ses01M_script02_1_M043	367.3200	375.7175	like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies and they all turned as one
Ses01M_script02_1_M044	375.8875	383.5400	and form the line and started swimming swimming that would bring them to this point here
Ses01M_script02_1_M045	383.7800	391.4700	it s like urgency that s pure urge you know it s single mindedness with no mind
Ses01M_script02_1_M046	393.6300	401.8275	it s crazy look at this i m giving myself goose bumps the hairs are standing up on my arm
Ses01M_script02_1_F024	402.0100	405.0400	that s the wind
