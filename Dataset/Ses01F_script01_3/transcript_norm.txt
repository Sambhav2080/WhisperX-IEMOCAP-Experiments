Ses01F_script01_3_M025	251.5000	259.7300	it s just all mixed up with so many other things you know you know overseas i was in command of a company
Ses01F_script01_3_F028	259.1300	261.6600	yeah sure
Ses01F_script01_3_M026	261.7500	264.9617	well i lost them

Ses01F_script01_3_M027	268.5600	270.7875	pretty much all
Ses01F_script01_3_F030	270.6600	273.2600	aw geez
Ses01F_script01_3_M028	272.4400	283.5024	you can t just toss off a thing like that because they weren t just men you know
Ses01F_script01_3_M029	283.7300	304.5800	like for instance there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks he just put them in my pocket that s a little thing you know but that s what kind of guys i had
Ses01F_script01_3_M030	304.7751	319.9900	they didn t die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly just a little more selfish and they would all be here today
Ses01F_script01_3_M031	320.9000	344.4800	and i had this idea as i was watching them go down everything was being destroyed you know but this one thing was being made it was kind of a monument it s kind of responsibility man for man
Ses01F_script01_3_F031	344.1800	345.7400	mmhmm
Ses01F_script01_3_M032	345.9000	359.2200	to bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and i thought i would just make a difference to them
Ses01F_script01_3_M033	360.2517	378.3500	but then i came home and it was incredible you know the whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident you know i went back to the rat race again i went to work
Ses01F_script01_3_M034	378.4700	383.6500	driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator
Ses01F_script01_3_M035	384.5200	400.6480	i mean you can t take those things out of a war when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man
Ses01F_script01_3_M036	401.9100	412.5900	and i didn t want any of it i guess that included you
Ses01F_script01_3_F032	415.8011	419.8444	do you still feel that way
Ses01F_script01_3_M037	419.4437	422.5035	i just want you to know annie
Ses01F_script01_3_F033	422.4670	432.4477	because you mustn t feel that way everything you have you ve earned everything you understand me
Ses01F_script01_3_F034	432.5570	450.4700	even me and your money chris there s nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes into the air you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that
Ses01F_script01_3_M038	451.0400	460.2800	annie annie i am going to make a fortune for you
Ses01F_script01_3_F035	459.5700	463.0600	what would i do with a fortune
