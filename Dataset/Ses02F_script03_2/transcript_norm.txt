Ses02F_script03_2_M000	4.6200	8.2800	as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden
Ses02F_script03_2_F000	7.5900	10.0300	honey you knew there was nothing in that
Ses02F_script03_2_M001	9.5800	12.6200	i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him
Ses02F_script03_2_F001	12.2400	15.0900	presents just a trivial little broach
Ses02F_script03_2_M002	14.4100	20.1700	ah yes i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste
Ses02F_script03_2_F002	19.0700	23.3500	no it wasn t it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often
Ses02F_script03_2_M003	23.0300	26.3000	you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden
Ses02F_script03_2_F003	25.1500	29.6300	no i didn t you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination
Ses02F_script03_2_M004	28.9700	31.7100	you must admit he was in love with you wasn t he
Ses02F_script03_2_F004	31.1600	34.1000	just a little perhaps nothing serious
Ses02F_script03_2_M005	33.7500	35.7900	you let him kiss you you said you did
Ses02F_script03_2_F005	35.4700	36.9100	well what of it
Ses02F_script03_2_M006	36.6600	37.8300	what of it
Ses02F_script03_2_F006	37.4400	42.1100	it didn t hurt him at all and i enjoyed it
Ses02F_script03_2_M007	41.8500	43.9400	well what about me
Ses02F_script03_2_F007	43.8300	48.3300	well if you hadn t been so suspicious and nosey you never would have known a thing about it
Ses02F_script03_2_M008	48.0300	50.8200	well that s a nice point of view i must say
Ses02F_script03_2_F008	50.8000	53.0600	i m bored with this conversation
Ses02F_script03_2_M009	52.7500	56.9000	me too bored stiff you want some brandy
Ses02F_script03_2_F009	56.5600	58.1200	no thanks

Ses02F_script03_2_F010	59.4100	63.1300	don t see why you want any you ve already had two glasses
Ses02F_script03_2_M011	63.2000	66.6400	no particular reason anyhow they were very small ones
Ses02F_script03_2_F011	66.6500	70.7700	just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing
Ses02F_script03_2_M012	70.5000	76.5400	you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on
Ses02F_script03_2_F012	75.5400	78.3300	well it s become a habit with you
Ses02F_script03_2_M013	77.5600	82.4000	you needn t be so grand just because you don t happen to want any yourself at the moment
Ses02F_script03_2_F013	81.2800	83.3600	don t be so stupid
Ses02F_script03_2_M014	82.6400	84.2300	really amanda

Ses02F_script03_2_M017	94.3700	96.8300	that reply has broken my heart
Ses02F_script03_2_F016	96.5600	101.8200	a woman s job is to allure the man watch me a minute will you
Ses02F_script03_2_M018	101.6700	104.2300	as a matter of fact that s perfectly true
Ses02F_script03_2_F017	103.8300	105.5700	no it isn t
Ses02F_script03_2_M019	104.8700	106.2500	yes it is
Ses02F_script03_2_F018	105.6100	107.7100	oh be quiet
Ses02F_script03_2_M020	107.2000	111.5600	ah it s a pity you didn t have any more brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable
Ses02F_script03_2_F019	110.5000	113.5500	doesn t seem to have worked such wonders with you
Ses02F_script03_2_M021	113.0700	115.8000	snap snap snap like a little adder
Ses02F_script03_2_F020	115.5200	117.5600	adders don t snap they sting
Ses02F_script03_2_M022	117.1700	121.1900	nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap
Ses02F_script03_2_F021	120.5000	121.6800	they sting
Ses02F_script03_2_M023	121.2100	122.6900	they snap
Ses02F_script03_2_F022	122.0300	127.8900	i don t care do you understand i don t care i don t care if they bark or roll about like hoops
Ses02F_script03_2_M024	128.8500	132.6300	did you see much of peter burden after our divorce
Ses02F_script03_2_F023	132.3600	134.5600	yes i did quite a lot
Ses02F_script03_2_M025	134.3600	137.9700	hmm i imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then
Ses02F_script03_2_F024	137.7400	139.5100	mind your own business
Ses02F_script03_2_M026	139.0600	145.5800	oh must have had a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable and never had much anyhow
Ses02F_script03_2_F025	145.0800	146.9400	you re quite insufferable
Ses02F_script03_2_F026	146.9600	148.6000	i expect it s because you re drunk
Ses02F_script03_2_M027	148.2500	150.5600	i m not in the least drunk
Ses02F_script03_2_F027	149.7000	152.0600	you ve always had a weak head
Ses02F_script03_2_M028	151.6600	159.6700	as i mentioned before i have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn t get drunk on that
Ses02F_script03_2_F028	158.7800	163.6000	on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
Ses02F_script03_2_M029	163.2700	168.5800	oh very interesting how about a child of four a child of six or a child of nine
Ses02F_script03_2_F029	167.4500	169.2900	shut up
Ses02F_script03_2_M030	168.6300	172.8500	we could get a good debate going about this don t you think intemperate tots
