Ses04F_script01_3_F020	168.7525	173.6393	well then what s wrong even in your letters there was something ashamed

Ses04F_script01_3_F021	180.4572	183.6400	you ve got to tell me
Ses04F_script01_3_M025	183.0188	185.6900	i don t know where to start
Ses04F_script01_3_F022	185.0900	188.1200	it wouldn t work this way
Ses04F_script01_3_M026	188.3100	193.6989	there s so many things mixed up
Ses04F_script01_3_M027	193.7383	197.3900	you remember overseas i was in command of a company
Ses04F_script01_3_F023	196.8200	199.2162	yeah sure
Ses04F_script01_3_M028	198.4674	202.1300	well i lost them
Ses04F_script01_3_F024	201.5808	203.7483	how many
Ses04F_script01_3_M029	203.1900	205.5400	just about all
Ses04F_script01_3_F025	205.4000	207.4923	oh gees
Ses04F_script01_3_M030	207.2558	214.7042	it takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren t just men
Ses04F_script01_3_M031	214.7831	224.9508	for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks
Ses04F_script01_3_M032	225.0690	233.5900	i put them in my pocket that s only a little thing but these are the kind of guys i had
Ses04F_script01_3_M033	236.3300	244.9709	they didn t die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they d have been here today
Ses04F_script01_3_M034	245.3300	255.1500	and i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made
Ses04F_script01_3_M035	255.2200	260.8925	a sort of responsibility man for man you understand me
Ses04F_script01_3_M036	261.0501	265.2000	and then i came home and it was amazing
Ses04F_script01_3_M037	265.7100	270.0700	there was no meaning in it here
Ses04F_script01_3_M038	270.3902	277.9569	the whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident then i went to work with father and that whole rat race again
Ses04F_script01_3_M039	277.9963	282.3800	i felt what you said ashamed somehow
Ses04F_script01_3_M040	282.7649	291.1985	because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys
Ses04F_script01_3_M041	291.2380	299.0411	i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator
Ses04F_script01_3_M042	299.1199	302.5880	i mean you can take those things out of war but
Ses04F_script01_3_M043	302.6274	311.8492	when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man you ve got to be a little better because of that
Ses04F_script01_3_M044	311.8887	319.1500	otherwise what you have is really just loot and there s blood on it i didn t want to take any of it
Ses04F_script01_3_M045	319.6000	323.1204	i guess that included you
Ses04F_script01_3_F026	321.9775	324.8300	and do you still feel that way
Ses04F_script01_3_M046	324.5200	326.5885	i want you now annie
Ses04F_script01_3_F027	326.0000	333.5400	because you mustn t feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have chris do you understand everything
Ses04F_script01_3_F028	333.6100	340.7009	that includes me and your money there s nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes in the air
Ses04F_script01_3_F029	340.7200	343.9288	you should be proud a man should be paid for that
Ses04F_script01_3_M047	343.6529	347.7909	annie annie i m going to make a fortune for you
Ses04F_script01_3_F030	347.3900	350.2800	what ll i do with a fortune
