Ses04M_script01_3_F018	165.9592	170.2400	then what s wrong even in your letters there was something ashamed
Ses04M_script01_3_M022	169.8100	174.8874	yes i suppose there has been but it s going from me
Ses04M_script01_3_F019	174.5873	177.2600	you ve got to tell me
Ses04M_script01_3_M023	178.5700	181.6000	i don t know where to start
Ses04M_script01_3_F020	181.0700	184.1000	it wouldn t work this way
Ses04M_script01_3_M024	184.3400	193.6441	it s all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in command of a company
Ses04M_script01_3_F021	193.3439	195.3697	yeah sure
Ses04M_script01_3_M025	194.8445	198.8959	well i lost them
Ses04M_script01_3_F022	198.5208	201.2968	how many
Ses04M_script01_3_M026	200.7716	203.2475	just about all
Ses04M_script01_3_F023	203.1725	205.4100	oh gees
Ses04M_script01_3_M027	206.7200	212.4758	it takes a little time to toss that off because they weren t just men
Ses04M_script01_3_M028	212.5508	227.3600	for instance one time it d been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket that s only a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had
Ses04M_script01_3_M029	227.4800	236.6300	they didn t die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they d have been here today
Ses04M_script01_3_M030	239.0500	250.9300	and i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but to me it seemed there was one new thing that was made
Ses04M_script01_3_M031	250.9900	262.5800	a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me and then i went home and it was incredible
Ses04M_script01_3_M032	262.9300	279.6400	there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident then i went to work for dad and that whole rat race again i felt what you said ashamed somehow
Ses04M_script01_3_M033	279.7700	290.2700	because nobody was changed it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive
Ses04M_script01_3_M034	291.0600	305.6300	to open that bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take these things out of a war but when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man
Ses04M_script01_3_M035	306.5600	321.9100	you have to be a little better because of that otherwise we have is really loot and there s blood on it i don t want to take any of it i guess that included you
Ses04M_script01_3_F024	321.8500	324.4600	and do you still feel that way
Ses04M_script01_3_M036	324.0000	326.2800	i want you now annie
Ses04M_script01_3_F025	325.9162	333.1938	because you mustn t feel that way anymore chris because you have a right to everything you have everything chris to me too
Ses04M_script01_3_F026	333.3300	341.6200	and your money there s nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes in the air you should be proud a man should be paid for that
Ses04M_script01_3_M037	341.0400	344.6000	annie annie i m going to make you a fortune
Ses04M_script01_3_F027	344.2400	346.8002	what ll i do with a fortune
