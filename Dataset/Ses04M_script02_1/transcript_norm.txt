Ses04M_script02_1_F013	149.0700	156.2800	pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then they swim away and then they die
Ses04M_script02_1_M019	155.7300	167.0880	yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives i mean all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that

Ses04M_script02_1_M022	183.1200	193.3300	yeah they do okay but it s fish who do something none of the other fish do like the swallows are returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that

Ses04M_script02_1_M023	193.3900	201.3200	there s mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable i don t see how you can not be interested
Ses04M_script02_1_F016	200.8100	203.1767	i m just not
Ses04M_script02_1_M024	202.4663	204.3134	for real

Ses04M_script02_1_M025	205.8300	219.1500	i don t get it first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited to get here you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn t even notice until we were in the car
Ses04M_script02_1_F018	218.7400	228.8935	last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we got into a big fight over nothing you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions
Ses04M_script02_1_M026	228.4199	231.5300	we weren t in a good spot
Ses04M_script02_1_F019	230.9900	233.9600	we didn t see them the first time either
Ses04M_script02_1_M027	233.5100	244.1910	we just weren t in a good spot this is a much better spot i ve got good instincts for these things look there what s that is that
Ses04M_script02_1_M028	244.3200	258.6359	no it s just seaweed isn t it oh man this is great i wouldn t miss this for anything i mean think about this i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute
Ses04M_script02_1_M029	258.7307	271.7548	out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way they don t know why we don t know why it wasn t a decision they didn t take a vote no one sent them an invitation or a map
Ses04M_script02_1_M030	271.7969	281.7952	just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming
Ses04M_script02_1_M031	281.8500	291.4900	they re swimming right now as if that s the only thing that matters it s single mindedness with no mind urgency that s pure urge
Ses04M_script02_1_M032	291.5700	309.6906	they don t know what drives them they don t give it a name or ask a question they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh man i m giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up
Ses04M_script02_1_F020	309.3591	311.8692	that s the wind
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	311.3956	314.0951	well so what did you think
Ses04M_script02_1_F021	313.7000	315.4500	about what
