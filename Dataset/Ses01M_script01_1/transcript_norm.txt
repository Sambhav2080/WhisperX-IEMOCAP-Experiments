Ses01M_script01_1_M025	258.2900	267.6200	well if she does then that s the end of it however from her letters i think she s pretty much forgotten him
Ses01M_script01_1_F028	268.7405	274.2300	the trouble is you don t see enough women you never did

Ses01M_script01_1_F029	278.1000	281.2100	i don t see why it has to be annie
Ses01M_script01_1_M027	280.3900	282.4625	because it is
Ses01M_script01_1_F030	281.5900	289.5300	that s a good answer but it doesn t answer anything you haven t seen her since you went away to war it s been five years
Ses01M_script01_1_M028	288.4200	295.5900	i don t know it i think of her i grew up next to her she is what i think of when i think of a wife
