Ses01F_script03_2_M001	9.5600	16.0125	however i believe the real cause of that row was peter burden
Ses01F_script03_2_F001	15.4800	19.5500	oh you knew there was nothing in that
Ses01F_script03_2_M002	18.6600	23.0400	i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him
Ses01F_script03_2_F002	22.3100	26.1300	presents it was only a trivial little brooch
Ses01F_script03_2_M003	25.7100	29.8700	it was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste too
Ses01F_script03_2_F003	29.2200	34.5800	it was not i still have it and i wear it often it is very pretty
Ses01F_script03_2_M004	34.2100	38.4400	you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden
Ses01F_script03_2_F004	37.5000	43.1500	i did not you worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination
Ses01F_script03_2_M005	42.2500	47.1200	well you let him kiss you huh you said you did
Ses01F_script03_2_F005	46.7500	48.7825	well what of it

Ses01F_script03_2_F006	49.4100	53.4700	it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn t hurt me
Ses01F_script03_2_M007	52.6700	55.2693	what about me
Ses01F_script03_2_F007	54.7489	61.4654	if you hadn t been so suspicious and nosey you never would have known a thing about it
Ses01F_script03_2_M008	60.8262	64.8857	that s a nice point of view i must say
Ses01F_script03_2_F008	64.3325	67.5625	oh dear i m bored with this conversation

Ses01F_script03_2_F011	84.4600	88.9700	i just think it s silly to go on and on and on about such a thing
Ses01F_script03_2_M012	88.0800	94.2300	you can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long going on and on and on
Ses01F_script03_2_F012	93.8500	96.9300	it s become a habit with you
Ses01F_script03_2_M013	95.9900	100.9500	oh don t be so grand just because you don t happen to want one at the moment

Ses01F_script03_2_F016	121.9500	126.5400	oh it s a woman s duty to allure the man
Ses01F_script03_2_M018	126.1529	129.1350	well as a matter of fact yes that s perfectly true
Ses01F_script03_2_F017	128.7100	130.4800	no it isn t

Ses01F_script03_2_M020	132.3100	137.4000	oh really it s a pity you didn t have any brandy it would have made you a little less disagreeable
Ses01F_script03_2_F019	137.1300	141.1970	it s funny it hasn t worked such wonders for you
Ses01F_script03_2_M021	140.8379	144.0300	snap snap snap you know you are like a little adder
Ses01F_script03_2_F020	143.6400	146.3800	adders don t snap they sting
Ses01F_script03_2_M022	145.6700	152.9500	nonsense they have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap they snap
Ses01F_script03_2_F021	149.9800	158.4966	they sting i don t care do you understand i don t care if they bark and they roll about like hoops
Ses01F_script03_2_M023	157.8200	161.5400	did you see much of peter burden after our divorce
Ses01F_script03_2_F022	160.7500	163.3800	yes i did quite a lot
Ses01F_script03_2_M024	162.7700	175.5200	and i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than too yes i suppose you guys had a riotous time huh all out no restraint at all well you never really had much anyhow
Ses01F_script03_2_F023	165.6900	167.9300	mind your own business
Ses01F_script03_2_F024	175.1100	179.4600	you re quite insufferable i expect it s because you are drunk
Ses01F_script03_2_M025	178.7700	183.2600	i think i am not in the least bit drunk
Ses01F_script03_2_F025	182.0300	184.9100	you ve always had a weak head
Ses01F_script03_2_M026	184.3500	193.4894	i think i mentioned once before that i ve had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long a child of two cannot get drunk on that
Ses01F_script03_2_F026	193.0300	198.8800	on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy
Ses01F_script03_2_M027	197.9100	212.7500	that s very interesting amanda how about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine we can get a good little conversation going on about this you know intemperate tots
