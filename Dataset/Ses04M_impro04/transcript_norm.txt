Ses04M_impro04_M013	141.1800	143.7800	this is stupid
Ses04M_impro04_F009	144.6100	147.6500	i mean i m not saying that you should you know
Ses04M_impro04_M014	147.3400	149.5000	you know what this is your fault
Ses04M_impro04_F010	149.0900	150.4100	excuse me
Ses04M_impro04_M015	150.0300	161.4700	it s your fault cause cause you always told me to to do this and i did that instead and i didn t take your advice and and but you sort of were like were telling
Ses04M_impro04_F011	160.1100	162.8300	it s my fault cause you didn t do what i told you to
Ses04M_impro04_M016	161.8200	163.4900	yeah exactly
Ses04M_impro04_F012	163.0500	164.8300	well that sounds like your fault

Ses04M_impro04_F013	165.3900	168.7200	you didn t do what i told you to do
Ses04M_impro04_M018	168.3800	177.7600	that s cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing and i thought this time it was i was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing so it s your fault because
Ses04M_impro04_M019	177.7900	185.7800	because you were always wrong and and and this time you were right and and i didn t yeah that s why
Ses04M_impro04_F014	185.4300	189.3200	that s amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault
Ses04M_impro04_M020	188.7700	191.8300	well i mean it makes sense doesn t it hmm
Ses04M_impro04_F015	190.5900	195.4300	i think maybe you can t get employed because you aren t willing to take responsibility for your own actions
Ses04M_impro04_M021	195.3000	199.7200	that s not true i take responsibility for my own actions
Ses04M_impro04_F016	198.9000	201.9000	really whose fault is it you don t have a job
Ses04M_impro04_M022	202.2000	205.9000	yours i don t
Ses04M_impro04_F018	205.9042	208.6800	you see what you just did there though
