Ses05M_script01_3_F019	200.5200	204.7000	even in your letters there was something ashamed
Ses05M_script01_3_M021	205.1700	210.6900	yeah i suppose i have been but it s going for me
Ses05M_script01_3_F020	211.1600	213.3700	you have to tell me
Ses05M_script01_3_M022	214.2000	216.6400	i don t i don t know where to start
Ses05M_script01_3_F021	216.9600	219.0581	it wouldn t work like this
Ses05M_script01_3_M023	220.3200	224.2900	it s so mixed up with so many other things
Ses05M_script01_3_M024	225.4600	229.8700	you remember when i was overseas i was in command of a company
Ses05M_script01_3_F022	229.2700	230.9500	yeah sure
Ses05M_script01_3_M025	231.5268	233.1245	i lost them
Ses05M_script01_3_F023	234.0200	235.6400	how many
Ses05M_script01_3_M026	236.3100	238.4200	just about all
Ses05M_script01_3_M027	241.8900	249.8300	it it takes time to toss something like that off i mean because they weren t just men
Ses05M_script01_3_M028	250.5300	263.2400	for instance there was this time and it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks just put them in my pocket
Ses05M_script01_3_M029	263.4100	278.5700	i know it s it s just a little thing but that s just the kind of guys i had they didn t die they killed themselves for each other
Ses05M_script01_3_M030	278.6600	291.3600	i mean that exactly anymore selfish just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today and it gave me an idea as i was watching them all go down
Ses05M_script01_3_M031	291.6400	308.2300	everything was being destroyed see but i felt like something new was being created at the same time like it kind of responsibility you know man to man do you understand what i m saying
Ses05M_script01_3_M032	308.7600	320.8700	and and to see that again to to bring that back on the earth again like like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them
Ses05M_script01_3_M033	320.9400	336.4500	it was and then i went home and it was incredible it didn t have any meaning there
Ses05M_script01_3_M034	336.5200	345.2700	i mean the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them
Ses05M_script01_3_M035	346.3400	350.3400	so i went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again
Ses05M_script01_3_M036	360.8700	371.3900	i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all
Ses05M_script01_3_M037	371.4300	383.6158	it seemed to make suckers out of so many guys and i i felt wrong to be alive to to open that bank book to to drive that car the new car and look at that new refrigerator i mean
Ses05M_script01_3_M038	383.6258	399.3100	you can take those things out of the war but if you re gonna drive that car you ve got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man and you ve got to be a little bit better because of that because if you re not then it s all just loot and there s blood on it and i didn t want any of it
Ses05M_script01_3_M039	403.0000	405.2800	and i guess that included you
Ses05M_script01_3_F024	406.5000	409.1800	do you still feel like that
Ses05M_script01_3_M040	410.9900	413.4300	i want you now annie
Ses05M_script01_3_F025	413.8400	424.4000	because you can t feel like that anymore chris because everything you have you have a right to me included
Ses05M_script01_3_F026	424.5800	430.9100	and you father he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud a man should be paid for that
Ses05M_script01_3_M041	430.4700	432.3400	oh annie
Ses05M_script01_3_F027	434.8300	437.7200	what will i do with a fortune
Ses05M_script01_3_M042	432.4000	435.1500	annie i am going to make you a fortune
M	0.0000	0.0000	oh
