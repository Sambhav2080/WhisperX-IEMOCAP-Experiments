Ses04F_script03_1_F020	131.5000	134.2300	elliott worms don t pop
Ses04F_script03_1_M025	133.7300	139.1900	i don t mind what you do see you can paint yourself green all over
Ses04F_script03_1_M026	139.2173	148.7084	and dance naked in the place place vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and i shan t say a word as long as you love me best
Ses04F_script03_1_F021	148.1200	155.4881	thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman i ll kill you
Ses04F_script03_1_M027	154.9584	157.4400	do you remember that awful scene in venice
Ses04F_script03_1_F022	157.0700	158.9900	which particular one

Ses04F_script03_1_M030	173.3200	175.1900	how long did that row last
Ses04F_script03_1_F025	174.6200	177.4797	it went on intermittently for days
Ses04F_script03_1_M031	176.9600	182.2800	the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown
Ses04F_script03_1_F026	181.6300	185.6100	it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom
Ses04F_script03_1_M032	185.1700	189.3500	ah we were much younger then that was a rouser wasn t it
Ses04F_script03_1_F027	188.7500	191.5700	that was the first time you ever hit me
Ses04F_script03_1_M033	190.7700	193.5200	you didn t hit me i didn t hit you very hard
Ses04F_script03_1_F028	192.9700	198.6100	then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers

Ses04F_script03_1_F030	203.3500	205.3900	and very much sillier
Ses04F_script03_1_M036	204.8900	208.4600	as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden
