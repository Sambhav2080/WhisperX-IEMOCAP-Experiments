Ses04F_script02_1_M021	133.5171	141.1200	think about the people in kansas they d have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this we re just forty minutes away it s too good to pass up
Ses04F_script02_1_F013	140.5000	148.3696	pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then swim away and then they die
Ses04F_script02_1_M022	147.6463	158.6500	yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that
Ses04F_script02_1_M023	158.7400	162.6200	this is the big night for these guys life s last orgy
Ses04F_script02_1_F014	162.0100	170.1100	what are you so excited about this isn t a moon landing we re talking about it s fish it s fish nobody even eats
Ses04F_script02_1_M024	169.6100	171.0500	yeah they do
Ses04F_script02_1_F015	170.5500	172.2000	oh augie
Ses04F_script02_1_M025	171.4800	174.6000	okay but it s fish who do something none of the other fish do
Ses04F_script02_1_M026	174.6300	183.4200	like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that there s mystery here and magic
Ses04F_script02_1_M027	183.4600	187.9500	a little bit of the unexplainable i don t see how you cannot be interested
Ses04F_script02_1_F016	187.4300	189.2593	i m just not
Ses04F_script02_1_M028	188.5300	190.3900	for real
Ses04F_script02_1_F017	189.9100	191.9113	yes
Ses04F_script02_1_M029	191.2700	203.9900	i don t get it the first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited to get here you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn t even notice until we were in the car
Ses04F_script02_1_F018	203.2600	213.0312	last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we got in a big fight over nothing you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions
Ses04F_script02_1_M030	212.4000	214.8300	we weren t in a good spot
Ses04F_script02_1_F019	214.0100	216.3300	we didn t see them the first time either
Ses04F_script02_1_M031	215.5100	219.4925	we just weren t in a good spot this is a much better spot
Ses04F_script02_1_M032	219.6000	227.3522	i ve got good instincts for these things look there what s that is that is that is that no it s just seaweed isn t it
Ses04F_script02_1_M033	227.4004	235.4048	ah man this is great i wouldn t miss this for anything i mean think about this i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute
Ses04F_script02_1_M034	235.5012	245.0500	out there someplace there s this huge mass of silver fish heading this way they don t know why we don t know why it wasn t a decision they didn t take a vote
Ses04F_script02_1_M035	245.0900	256.9586	no one sent them a map or an invitation just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming
Ses04F_script02_1_M036	257.0068	261.5876	they re swimming right now as if that s the only thing that matters
Ses04F_script02_1_M037	261.6400	266.7953	it s single mindedness with no mind urgency that s pure urge
Ses04F_script02_1_M038	266.8435	276.9500	they don t know what drives them they don t give it a name or ask question they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
Ses04F_script02_1_M039	276.9900	282.2400	where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death
Ses04F_script02_1_M040	282.6400	287.0200	ah i m giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up
Ses04F_script02_1_F020	286.5400	288.4300	that s the wind
Ses04F_script02_1_M041	287.8800	289.7500	well so what do you think
Ses04F_script02_1_F021	289.2700	290.9500	about what

Ses04F_script02_1_F022	291.9600	293.8500	it s ridiculous
