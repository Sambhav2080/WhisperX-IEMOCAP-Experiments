Ses03F_script02_1_M037	290.5800	303.2862	somewhere out there there s this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they don t know why and we don t know why just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off went off in their bodies
Ses03F_script02_1_M038	303.3267	314.3188	and they all all as one turned as one and formed this line as big as the california coast and started swimming this way swimming as if that s the only thing that matters

Ses03F_script02_1_M041	335.1725	344.9875	they don t ask it a question they just they just they don t know what drives them they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
Ses03F_script02_1_M042	345.0483	354.9200	where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh god i m giving myself goosebumps look i m all all my hairs on my arms is sticking up
